# Operation Surprise Birthday!

This repository is dedicated to planning and documenting the surprise birthday party I'm throwing for my sister, Grace. It's top secret, so please don't breathe a word of it to her!

## The Plan

The goal is to completely surprise Grace with a themed party (80's theme) on her birthday, October 27th.

**Key elements of the surprise:**

* **Venue booking:** Reserved the back room at "The Retro Diner".
* **Guest list:**  nothing.
* **Decorations:**  80's themed decorations - think neon colors, leg warmers, and a Rubik's Cube centerpiece.
* **Gifts:**  Planning to get her a vintage record player and a collection of her favorite 80's albums..
* **Activities:** 80's music playlist, photo booth with props, and a "best dressed" contest.
* **Food and drinks:**  The Retro Diner offers 80's themed food and cocktails. We've pre-ordered a birthday cake with a Rubik's Cube design.

* Decorations: $100 (estimated)
* Gifts: $250 (estimated)
* Food and drinks: $300 (estimated)
* Cake: $50

**Total estimated budget:** $900


## Contingency Plan

If "The Retro Diner" cancels, we'll switch to Plan B: hosting the party at our house.  We have enough space in the backyard, and we can rent a karaoke machine for an 80's sing-along.


## Notes and Ideas

* Look into renting a fog machine for the dance floor.
* Create a playlist of Grace's favorite 80's movies to play on a projector.

This project is a labor of love.  I can't wait to see the look on Grace's face when she realizes what we've planned for her! ❤️
